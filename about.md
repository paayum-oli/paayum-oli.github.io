This web log is run by `AG & NT` as a means of pondering over the intricacies of Bharathi's kavithais (poems) and their relevance in and/or influence over modern day Tamil popular culture, be it movies or songs. As with any venture that is destined for greatness (_trumpet bellows in the background_), this one has an _origins_ story as well.

<br>
Here goes! (not exact words, recreating the vague memory of a whatsapp conversation)


>>"Dude!"<br>
"Duuude!"<br>
"I was reading ``insert title`` paatu dude. That's sema mass."<br>
"Avarai ellam adichikkavae mudiyathu!"<br>
"Bloody mass dude, that boy! Neeyum padipaya?"<br>
"Ofcourse dude!"<br>
"We should do something. We should write up songs we like, and provide our own interpretations." <br>
"Dude, mass idea, we totally should! But antha alavu `gnaanam` laam illaiye enakku!" <br>
"Dude, namba interpretation, discussion maathiri oru format la! Aanithanama, ithu than sari nu sollavendame! " <br>
"Dude, kandippa dude, lets do this!" <br>
"Bloody mass, we are doing this" <br>

<br>
Several months later,
>> "Dude!"<br>
"Dude?" <br>
"(naaye, manathil) It is already June!"<br>
"Aaamala, sari, per choose pannuvom first!" <br>
"It has to do with light dude. Somehow."<br>

<br>
After a bit of dilly-dallying,

>> "பாயும் ஒளி நீ எனக்கு!" <br>
"Mass!"

AG is a consultant, draws, paints and is diving head first into photography. <br>
NT is an engineer, is slowly turning into a mountain goat and shares AG's love of photography. <br>
Both whole-heartedly believe _சோறு முக்கியம் !_ and are _உடன்-பிறவா உடன்பிறப்புகள் !_. (It's a thing!)
